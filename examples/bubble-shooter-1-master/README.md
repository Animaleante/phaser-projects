# Setup
To use this bootstrap youâ€™ll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project.

## 1. Clone this repo:

Navigate into your workspace directory.

Run:

```git clone path_to_git_repo```

## 2. Install Python Simple HTTP Server or Node http-server:

https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html

or

https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

npm install http-server -g


## 3. Run the development server:

Run:

```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080```

```http-server .```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.
